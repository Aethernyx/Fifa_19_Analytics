# Fifa_19_Analytics

In this project I start with the rough data of Fifa 19's player attributes. I clean the data to my liking to set it up for analysis.

After the data is cleaned I decide to build the best starting lineup of under 21 years old players, with each player having at least a 70 or higher rating of speed.

I begin by making decisions by looking at and visualizing different parts of the data, and later build a linear regression to determine the best options.
